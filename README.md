Hello!

These are games are made in HTML and CSS and JS excluding the snake game.

This is a collection of two of the most played games in the modern era:

1. Tik Tak Toe

The games are web appliations and to play them you need to find the "index.html" file and open it in your browser.
These games are not made my me and the code is publicly availale in Github.
The Readmes of the same written by the original creator is available in the respective folders.

I have not tested these games on any other browser than Chrome.
