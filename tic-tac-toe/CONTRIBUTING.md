## Introduction

Tic-Tac-Toe, a classic game of strategy and wit, pits two players against each other or against Computer in a battle for victory. With a simple grid and Xs and Os as markers, players strive to align three of their symbols in a row, testing their tactical skills and foresight.

## Issue #45- [Reset Board button doesn't reset the table everytime (wierd and glitchy)](https://github.com/yelynn1/tictactoe/issues/45)

When pressing the Reset Board button for the first time, it resets the game, and the AI plays first. Pressing it again allows you to play first, and pressing it a third time chooses a random player. Essentially, the button isn't functioning as intended; it should only reset the board.

To fix this bug, two separate buttons needs to be added. One button selects whether X or O plays first. For example, pressing the button for X resets the game, and X (the AI) places its symbol first. The same applies to the button for O.

### Detailed discussion of issue examined

* Button Implementation: Two buttons ("Play O first" and "Play X first") are added to HTML.
* Functionality: JavaScript functions handle button clicks, reset board, and randomize the starting player.
* Code Clarity: The code is structured and clear, improving maintainability and readability.

## Code

HTML Buttons:

Two HTML buttons are defined with IDs 'selectXButton' and 'selectOButton'. These buttons allow the user to choose to play as either X or O.

```
<button id="selectXButton" onclick="selectFirstPlayer('X')">Play O first</button>
<button id="selectOButton" onclick="selectFirstPlayer('O')">Play X first</button>
 ```

JavaScript Functions:

selectFirstPlayer Function:

```
const selectFirstPlayer = (symbol) => {
    reset_board(symbol);
}
```

 This function is triggered when one of the buttons ("Play as X" or "Play as O") is clicked. It takes a symbol ('X' or 'O') as a parameter and initiates the game by resetting the board with the selected first player.

 reset_board1 Function:

``` 
const reset_board1 = (firstPlayer) => {
    // Resetting game board and related elements
    // Clearing previous game state
    // Setting up the game for a new match
}
```
This function determines the starting player based on the user's choice and initiates the game.

Steps:

* Check if Game Board is Empty: Ensures that the game board is empty before determining the starting player.
* Handling First Player Preference: If firstPlayer parameter is provided (either 'X' or 'O'), the function sets the starting player accordingly.
* Initiating the Game: Calls functions such as showPlayer or addComputerMove to start the game with the chosen starting player.

## Code review and Outcomes:

To be done. 

## Reflection

By implementing separate buttons for selecting the starting player and modifying the code to handle the user's choice, I have effectively addressed the issue of inconsistent behavior in the game's starting player selection. The code now allows users to explicitly choose whether they want to play as X or O, ensuring clarity and consistency in the game initialization process. This modification enhances the user experience and eliminates the need for unnecessary randomization.
